# Worldbuilding Obsidian Template

# About

This repository contains a premade Obsidian Vault with the appropriate organization, templates, and plugins needed to get started with **your** fantasy worldbuilding!\

# How to install

Navigate to the releases section of this repository. Download the latest release. Unzip the zip folder archive in a safe file location. Open the folder as an obsidian vault.

# Regarding plugins

As Obsidian is updated, some plugins may become out of date, or will be abandoned. If this occurs, every effort will be made to update this worldbuilding template appropriately. Most plugins are incorporated only if they remain compatible markdown, or are considered too valuable not to use for supplementing your worldbuilding.

## Included Plugins

The following plugins are currently included within the worldbuilding template:

### Advanced Tables

Among other features, allows easier editing of tables within Obsidian.md.

### AidenLx's Folder Note

Allows users to create notes for a folder, that appear as the folder itself in the listing. For instance, you can make a folder for a city, and then click on that folder's name to open up the note page for that city. Very useful for creating categories and subcategories.

### Breadcrumbs

Offers handy visualization of data within the Obsidian vault.

### Fantasy Calendar

Offers personalized fantasy calendar integration into Obsidian.md. Useful if you are creating a custom time system.

### Kanban

Allows easy creation of Kanban boards and tasks within Obsidian.
