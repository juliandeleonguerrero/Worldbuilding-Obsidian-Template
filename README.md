# Worldbuilding Obsidian Template

# About

This repository contains a premade Obsidian Vault with the appropriate organization, templates, and plugins needed to get started with **your** fantasy worldbuilding!\

# How to install

Navigate to the releases section of this repository. Download the latest release. Unzip the zip folder archive in a safe file location. Open the folder as an obsidian vault.

# Regarding plugins

As Obsidian is updated, some plugins may become out of date, or will be abandoned. If this occurs, every effort will be made to update this worldbuilding template appropriately. Most plugins are incorporated only if they remain compatible with open file formats, such as markdown.
