# Worldbuilding Obsidian Template

# About

This repository contains a premade Obsidian vault, with pre-organized folders and templates to help you get started. Some helpful plugins have also been bundled into this repository!

Each template file comes pre-tagged and pre-formatted. The vault is made with the assumption of a typical Tolkien-eque fantasy world, though this really only impacts the folder organization- the templates are usually reusable for other settings.

# How to install

To get started, navigate to the releases section to the right, and download the latest release. Unzip the zip folder archive into a safe location, and then open that folder as an obsidian vault. You can rename the vault by renaming the root folder (`worldbuilding-template`).

# How to use

Users unfamiliar with Obsidian.md may wish to familiarize themselves with its core functionality [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian/Index), mainly in the "Getting Started" section. It's not too hard to pick up once you understand the base concepts, and is very powerful once you do!

Plugins extend the functionality of this vault. While an effort has been made to reduce plugins, some are just too useful to leave out. Each included plugin has its documentation embedded within the Vault.

# Ongoing Updates

Users are welcome to propose improvements to template files, or suggest new categories/templates be made. Improvement suggestions can be made in the Issues for this Git repository.

Plugins and attached themes will be updated as needed.

# Included Plugins

The following plugins are currently included within the worldbuilding template:

## Advanced Tables by Tony Grosinger

This is included for easier table editing within Obsidian.md. Markdown is a powerful method of editing, but tables are an admittedly weaker quality.

## AidenLx's Folder Note by AidenLx

This plugin allows users to create notes for a folder. When clicking on the folder name directly, the folder note will open. This is very useful for documenting what a folder is about within the worldbuilding template, and allows world builders to do the same when they create worldbuilding content.

## Breadcrumbs by SkepticMystic

Breadcrumbs is an organizational plugin with Obsidian. In short, it lets you define relationships between various notes, and better navigate through Obsidian thanks to this feature. It's hard to describe here- I would strongly recommend checking out Obsidian Hub's guide here: [Breadcrumbs Quickstart Guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/Guides/Breadcrumbs+Quickstart+Guide)
