# Locations
The locations folder is meant for outlining various locations within a fantasy world. 
## Folder Organization
There are two approaches to organizing this kind of folder.
1. Organizing by entity type. Bodies of water get their own folder, as do settlements, mountains, etc. If you take this approach, it is highly recommended to tag locations appropriately when connected.
2. More commonly, by hiearchy. As in, locations within a city will usually fall under a city.
## Creating a new location
There are five location templates, listed below. There is no harm in picking the wrong template initially- it is easy to re-tag an article and edit it to your tastes.
###  Establishment
Establishments are organized locations dedicated to providing some service or good. This definition is stretched broudly. Stores and restaurants fit here, as would churches, libraries, and schools. Industrial locations such as mines or farms could fit here as well, assuming they are not habitats at this point- at which point, they are probably appropriate as a natural location.
### Landmark
Landmarks are notable and prominent locations in the world. There is often bleedthrough between landmarks and establishments- a good test is determining whether the location is more significant for the services it offers, or the symbol/status of the location itself. If the latter is the case, it is likely a landmark. 

Landmarks can include anything from a dungeon, to a major church's headquarters. The point of the landmarks template is to help describe major locations not covered by the other use cases.
### Natural
Natural locations are meant for significant places in nature, such as mountains, forests, rivers, etc.

Region and natural locations are often similar- when in doubt, look at how the location is more significant. And remember that embeds can be used, so there is no harm in making two articles for the same location.

Once people live there and the location's primary use is as a living space for intelligent life, it is probably best categorized
