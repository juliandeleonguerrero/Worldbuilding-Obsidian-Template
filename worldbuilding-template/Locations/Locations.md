# Locations
The locations folder is meant for outlining various locations within a fantasy world. 
## Folder Organization
There are two approaches to organizing this kind of folder.
1. Organizing by entity type. Bodies of water get their own folder, as do settlements, mountains, etc. If you take this approach, it is highly recommended to tag locations appropriately when connected.
2. More commonly, by hiearchy. As in, locations within a city will usually fall under a city.
## Creating a new location
There are six location templates, listed below. There is no harm in picking the wrong template initially- it is easy to re-tag an article and edit it to your tastes.

Some general tips for picking the right location template:
- If it is more significant for containing other locations, it is best to use the region template.
- If it is more significant for its natural features, it is best to use the natural template.
- If it is more significant for the people that live there, it is best to use the location template.
Templates can always be edited and re-tagged after creation.
### Cosmology
Cosmological locations are space stuff- planets, stars, asteroids, and the universe itself.
###  Establishment
Establishments are organized locations dedicated to providing some service or good. This definition is stretched broudly. Stores, churches, libraries, etc would fit. Industrial locations such as mines or farms could fit here as well, assuming they are not full-blown ecosystems- at which point, they are probably appropriate as a natural location.
### Landmark
Landmarks are prominent locations in the world. This can include a dungeon, a major church headquarters, or a ruin. The point of the landmarks template is to help describe major locations not covered by the other use cases.
### Natural
Natural locations are places such as forests, mountains, or rivers.
### Region
Regions include continents, islands, and other locations that tend to contain other locations not well defined by the other location types.
### Settlements
Settlements include towns, villages, cities, and other localized groups of permanently-settled people.
