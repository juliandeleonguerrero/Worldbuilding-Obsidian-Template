# About

This is a worldbuilding template vault for use with the Obsidian.md notetaking software. The vault is pre-setup with basic organization, templates, and plugins you may find useful for your worldbuilding.

# Installing

You can "install" this worldbuilding template by navigating to the "Releases" page of the repo, and downloading the latest release (which should be available in the form of a .zip file). Extract that .zip file somewhere safe, rename the folder to the same name as your world, and then open it using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). 

You will receive a warning regarding the plugins installed, and whether you should trust the author upon opening the vault. For obvious reasons, you should always be weary of random content available online... but you can totally trust this vault. ;)

## Git

For the technically-minded, this repo can be cloned via Git. Make sure to rename the folder to an appropriate world name when doing so. I strongly recommend using Git in general, versus a cloud sync service given that almost all of your work here will be plain text. See [[04- Git and Worldbuilding]] for more details.

# Getting Started

*See these instructions once you have installed the vault onto your device*

Want to get started without reading through all of the documentation? Feel free, though it's strongly recommended you at least review [[01- Getting Started]].
