# Templates
The Templates folder exists to store templates that can be used throughout this worldbuilding project. Each template comes with basic tags already created, content headers pre-organized, and in some cases, infoboxes already created. Conveniently, they'll even grab the title of the note you've made, saving you on time editing!

To use a template, simply create a note and title it appropriately, and then insert a template into that note. For convenience's sake, you can try setting a hotkey for inserting templates- I've found that Ctrl+Shift+i works very well.
