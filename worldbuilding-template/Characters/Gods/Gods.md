Explain how gods are viewed in your setting. Give a brief overview of the context in which they are treated. Give a bit of context into how they are used/worshipped within your setting.

# History
If relevant, offer a bit of history behind the gods, and the powers they have. Perhaps take this time to mention some key pieces of interest on how they arose, or how the world formed- also make sure to make an event out of this as well.
