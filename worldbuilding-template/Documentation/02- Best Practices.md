Articles can be given tags, such as how this one is tagged "documentation".

If this isn't a problem for you, that's fine. If not, you may consider arc-specific folders.

Important worldbuilding elements of your campaign can still be documented elsewhere. But for campaign-specific content, you might make a section for a specific arc (generally a range of levels) within each
