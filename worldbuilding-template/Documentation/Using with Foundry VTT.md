# Foundry VTT and Obsidian
Obsidian.md is a markdown editor- this means that most syntax can be copied and pasted into Foundry VTT, if you are using the markdown journal entries! There are a few caveats to this:
- Infoboxes (referrred to as callouts here) will not appear right within Foundry VTT, and will instead appear as misshapen tables.
- Table of contents will not function within Foundry VTT.
- Built-in reference links in Obsidian.md will fail to work within Foundry VTT.
