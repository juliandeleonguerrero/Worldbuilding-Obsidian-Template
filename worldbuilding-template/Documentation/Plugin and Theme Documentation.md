# About Plugins
This worldbuilding template project attemps to minimize the amount of included plugins. This is to help avoid the need to update the plugins constantly, and to ensure the template does not become dependent on too many third-party projects.

However, some plugins are simply too useful for worldbuilding to leave out, or are otherwise handy, and will not disrupt the template should they be discontinued.
