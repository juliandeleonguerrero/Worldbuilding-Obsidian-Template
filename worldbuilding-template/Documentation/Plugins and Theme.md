# About Plugins
This worldbuilding template project attempts to minimize the included plugins. This helps avoid the need to track and update countless plugins, and to ensure the template does not become dependent on too many third-party projects.

However, some plugins are simply too useful for worldbuilding to leave out, or are otherwise handy, and will not disrupt the template should they be discontinued.

Each plugin used is listed below, along with a link to the relevant project.

## Advanced Tables by Tony Grosinger
This is included for easier table editing within Obsidian.md. Markdown is a powerful method of editing, but tables are an admittedly weaker quality. This plugin makes it a little easier to manage tables within a note.

## AidenLx's Folder Note by AidenLx
This plugin allows users to create notes associated with a folder. When clicking on the folder name directly, the folder note will open. This is very useful for documenting what a folder is about within the worldbuilding template, and allows world builders to do the same when they create worldbuilding content.

## Fantasy Calendar by Jeremy Valentine
This plugin allows users to set up personalized fantasy calendars within Obsidian.md. These calendars can be displayed within Obsidian.md, and reference notes as events within that calendar.

## Folder Note Core by AidenLx
This is a dependency required for AidenLx's Folder note plugin.

## Obsidian Leaflet by Valentine195
This allows for defining images as maps, and placing pins on the map that link back internally to Obsidian content. This is very helpful for helping to outline a map and give depth to locations in it.

## Short Internal Links to Headings by Scott Willmoore
This shortens internal links within Obsidian.md to the headers, where applicable. It helps make notes noticably neater.

## Tag Wrangler by pjeby
The Tag Wrangler plugin is a powerful addition that allows mass tag management, including merging, renaming, and other incredibly useful features.

## Waypoint by IdreesInc
Among other very useful features, the Waypoint plugin allows dynamically updating table of contents for a folder. This is used within the folder notes for the category, and can be handy for world builders who like to review a folder's contents within a note.

## And the ITS Theme by SlRvb
While not technically a plugin, the ITS theme looks slick as all heck, and most importantly makes a number of changes to the infobox feature in Obisidan- giving it a wiki-like appearance perfect for your worldbuilding.
