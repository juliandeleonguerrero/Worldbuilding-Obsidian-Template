# Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure that the you've opened the worldbuilding template correctly within Obsidian. It should look something like the following:

If all of this is a folder deep, and/or you lack bundled plugins/themes, you will need to re-open the worldbuilding template a folder deeper.

## Renaming

After opening the worldbuilding vault, you will probably want to rename it for your own world. Renaming the root folder for the Obsidian vault in your file browser of choice will successfully rename your project in Obsidian.

## Creating your first note

Obsidian supports templates to make your life easier! The templates included with this worldbuilding template account for most of what you'll need for typical fantasy worldbuilding. 

Find yourself needing another template anyways? Go ahead and create one under the Templates folder. After you've done so, you'll be able to insert it into any document you create. Every template is pre-tagged, and has some pre-set organization that you can feel free to play around with. Remember, it's your world building!

## Tagging

I recommend keeping tags shorter, but readable. In some cases you'll want to add additional tags to better categorize and link your content- keeping them short will let you do that, and get back to what really matters, which is world building.

## How Obsidian Works

Rather than explaining here, I would recommend reading Obsidian's documentation [here](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+custom+styles). I specifically recommend skimming through the "Getting Started" and "How To" sections.
